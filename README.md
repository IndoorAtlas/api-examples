# IndoorAtlas Positioning API examples

IndoorAtlas provides a unique Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that runs a disruptive geomagnetic positioning in its full-stack hybrid technology for accurately pinpointing a location inside a building. The IndoorAtlas SDK enables app developers to use high-accuracy indoor positioning in venues that have been fingerprinted.

These examples showcase IndoorAtlas Positioning API which is a lightweight REST API and can be used to do single shot positioning using WiFi scans of the device (e.g. personal computer or mobile phone). 

Getting started requires you to set up a free developer account and fingerprint your indoor venue using the [IndoorAtlas MapCreator 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indooratlas.android.apps.jaywalker).
